                    <b>Introduction</b><hr/>
                    This is a brief summary of everything I learned throughout the first week of the Reset Phase here at Nearsoft/Encora, from readings to videos. I hope you enjoy it.<br>
                    <b>About ideas and its execution</b><hr/>
                    In his talks, “Creative Thinking Hacks” and “How Progress Really Happens”, Scott Berkun talks about two main things: ideas and its execution. He starts stating that, and I quote: “ideas are made from other ideas”. Analyzing this sentence doesn’t really require that much of approval: we can easily second this assertion by looking at… anything, as long it has been created by a human being. If we look at Stephen King’s works, we can clearly see his tales are influenced by Edgar Allan Poe’s works, by Lovecraft’s works and a whole lot of other really good writers. God, even language is made from other languages (i.e. Spanish is derived from Latin, and Spanish borrows a lot of good words from English and other languages). But Berkun is not satisfied with only stating that, he wants to dig deeper. So, he states that, and I quote: “we constraint our ideas based on assumptions”. This assertion may not look easy to discern at first but it is certainly true. As soon as he stated that, he was bringing up some useful hacks to apply when you have an idea. Furthermore, Derek Sivers in his article “Ideas are just a multiplier of execution” refers to ideas as being worth nothing unless executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.<br>
                    In the second talk I mentioned, Berkun focuses on teaching why we don’t like change: because it creates work. It requires thinking. We are only motivated to change when things get unpleasant. And power is a necessary part of making change happen.<br>
                    The “tactics you should know” about continuing an idea are the following: Make a pilot, show success, find allies, ask for more resources, stake reputation, repeat!<br>
                    As we can see, there is a loop in there, but how does it really work? Well, let’s say I have an idea; I make an alpha version of that idea; I test it; then I look for allies (showing the results of my testing); the more allies I get, the more supported my project becomes, because allies means more resources. Resources means better versions of my project, better versions means better results and so on.<br>
                    Something really curious and worth-telling happened: I was there, sitting towards my computer, watching the talk, when he started talking about the actual hacks, and all of the sudden an idea arrived. An idea to solve a problem I didn’t even notice I had. This has happened to me before: Me, doing some task or just sitting there playing video games, when unexpectedly an idea pops out in my mind. I like to think about this as my muse telling me “you are meant to do great things”. But, in all the previous appearances of my muse, I didn’t even bother to write that idea down. Because I didn't even think about writing it down, I just liked it staying in my mind. Now it's different: I wrote it down in a random piece of paper and I am willing to continue with the rest of Berkun’s hacks.<br>
                    <b>About learning and self-transcendence</b><hr/>
                    Alright, self-transcendence: let’s save it for the end. Learning… The video “Peak: How to Master Anything” and the talk “Making Badass Developers” may focus on different things, but in the end both talk about learning. The video is really short and focuses on changing our way of thinking that “simply doing something for hours and hours is no guarantee that we'll improve”. It states that Masters have achieved mastery because they've come up with effective mental representations that allowed them to re-create entire experiences in their mind, to accurately predict and to condense information.<br>
                    Kathy Sierra starts his talk, “Making Badass Developers” giving an example which some of us can relate to: you have a friend and he tells you “I know HTML, I want to become a web developer, what do you even have to know?” But asking the latter is not the right thing to do; instead we should ask  “how fast can I learn it?”<br>
                    Eventually, both the video and the talk, wants us to understand that the fact of having an expert by our sides will facilitate and improve how fast we learn without us even noticing it. This is absolutely true, and I can give a couple of short examples: I won't bring up school, because having a teacher giving lectures to 30 students is not equal to having a teacher giving lectures to only one person. So, first, my experience with my friends in Age of Empires 2. I love this game, I have played it since I was like 9 years old. But it wasn’t until I turned 15 when I discovered an online community that still played it. I found this clan named “MeX”, I applied to join, and I made friends. Friends that were a lot, a lot better than me. So I started playing with them. It is actually stunning how fast I became better at the game. I even became better than some of my friends, so I got together more time with my friends that were still better than me. And we improved together, to the point of being part of the 16 best mexican players in 2018. But those days are long gone, now I can easily picture myself improving my coding skills by having pair programming sessions with my mentors here at Nearsoft/Encora.<br>
                    As the Spanish saying goes, and I translate: “whom with wolves get together, to howl will learn”. I can easily relate this to John Ousterhout’s most profound life lessons.<br>
                    Now, about self-transcendence. Oh, I love these kinds of talks: about philosophy and human thinking instead of hard, feelingless theory. Jonathan Haidt gave a talk about Religion, evolution, and the ecstasy of self-transcendence. He started the talk asking the audience to picture the following, and I quote: “Think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms, most of which we are very familiar with. But, sometimes, a doorway appears from out of nowhere. And it opens onto a staircase. We climb the staircase, and experience a state of altered consciousness.”. The latter is… kinda weird. Altered consciousness? The only altered consciousness that I could think about at that moment was being drunk or being high.<br>
                    Based solely on the talk, I can scrutinize that Haidt’s view of self-transcendence  was some kind of “losing” ourselves and becoming simply a part of a whole; about joining with others to pursue moral ideas; because he ended the talk stating that the most powerful force ever known on this planet is human cooperation. A force for construction and destruction.<br>
                    "No man's an island entire of itself. Every man is a piece of a continent: a part of the main."<br>
                    <b>About talking and communication</b><hr/>
                    I’ll start talking about talking (See that pun? Man, I’m good at this).<br>
                    There are two kinds of people in this life: those who walk into a room and say, “Well, here I am!” and those who walk in and say, “Ahh, there you are”. Leil Lowndes wrote about it in his book “How to Talk to Anyone”. And not only that, he, prophet of the lord, dedicated a whole book to teach us some Tips & Tricks when it comes to talking and I think we, introverts and people with not that much of communication skills, greatly appreciate it. He covers topics like body language, how to express feelings using our eyes, how to start/continue a conversation, how to be an insider in any crowd, how to do things “Like the Big Shots Do”, and a whole broth of different topics. Lowndes even brings up things like How to Talk When You’re in Other Countries: a lot of his Tips & Tricks may seem obvious to do, but in practice we barely notice them. When I was reading through the summary I quickly noticed that I’ve seen a lot of those Tips & Tricks in movies, because I was recalling those scenes. A really interesting reading. (By the way, Communication Class is happening today! I’m so excited!)<br>

                    <b>About X Workflow</b><hr/>
                    If I’m totally honest, I can’t say I learned anything from the article “Missing semester: The linux shell” because I have worked with linux before and, in a couple of school homeworks, I had to investigate deeper in how it works. So, the last topic shall be X Workflow.<br>
                    X Workflow introduces us to this “general process”: a cycle in which we live while we do things to work or understand the universe; which starts with Discovery, followed by a Definition, which unwraps Specification, which triggers Implementation accompanied by Analysis. Analysis triggers Discovery, and the loop continues.<br>
                    The whole workflow is focused on people, and I quote: “the main idea here is to look at the company as a single team. This means that even though you may not be included throughout the whole process, this is a single unit where some people take care of certain aspects, and you participate in your area of expertise in the overall process”. The latter is roughly a summary, of course, because the document unrolls every single part of the process. But, in the end,  X Workflow is focused on that.<br>

                    I… also learned about death. I learned that we, humans, are ephemeral beings. I learned that no matter how well your body is dealing with COVID, at any moment that defense may flaw and that’ll be it.<br>
