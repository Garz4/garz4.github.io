                <b>About habits and beliefs</b><hr/>
                Habits define us. This is nothing but the truth, and James Clear makes it very easy to understand; and not only that, but he also gives us some Tips & Tricks on how to build lasting and successful habits. In his article, “How to Build a New Habit: This is Your Strategy Guide”, he explains how starting with an incredibly small habit will make it easy for us; emphasizing that patience is everything. Furthermore, in “How To Start New Habits That Actually Stick” he introduces us to this infinite habit loop, in which a habit always starts with a cue, followed by a craving, satisfied with a response which leads to a reward. The reward triggers a cue, and the loop continues; a quote from that article that really stuck to me was “Every goal is doomed to fail if it goes against the grain of human nature”. Last, but definitely not least, we have “Identity-Based Habits: How to Actually Stick to Your Goals This Year”. James teaches us how creating a new identity is not a bad thing, because, and I quote: “the key to building lasting habits is focusing on creating a new identity first”. We, as humans, have lots and lots of things in common. Behaviour is one of them; and, in order to change our behaviour for good, we need to start believing new things about ourselves.

                <b>About connection and vulnerability</b><hr/>
                In her TED Talk, Brené Brown talks about how connection gives purpose and meaning to our lives. Her research states that shame is nothing but the fear of disconnection, because it unravels connection. Brené links it to the sense of worthiness which, at first glance, may not be remotely related, but it is; because this sense of worthiness is the outcome of having the courage to be imperfect. The people with a sense of worthiness fully embrace vulnerability, and I quote: “they believe that what makes them vulnerable, makes them beautiful”. She explains that we numb vulnerability, because we don’t want to feel it, and that is totally true. So, we also numb joy, gratitude and happiness. We pretend that what we’re doing doesn’t have a huge impact on other people. So, in order to start having this sense of worthiness, we need to let ourselves be seen, deeply seen, vulnerably seen. We need to love with our whole hearts. 

                <b>About professional training</b><hr/>
                I believe that the professional training begins with Ángel Pimentel’s talk, at the OctoberTalks, so I’ll start with that: this, by far, was the longest of the 5 required readings and videos. It starts with the Manifesto for Agile Software Development: many Agile projects are now, steadily and iteratively, producing mediocre software. According to Ángel, we do not only want to be individuals with robotic interactions between each other, but to be a real community full of professionals. So he brings up the term Software Craftsmanship: in his words, and I translate: “Software Craftsmanship is a practice set, not a religion. Agile and Craftsmanship complement each other. Agile assumes that there exists technical excellence, while Craftsmanship states that we need to improve that technical quality”. He finished this topic saying “the best way to learn something is to be along with someone who knows about it”, and thus he started talking about Tips & Tricks on how to make the transition from student to developer, and I am going to write the most important points he made:
                —Choose the programming language of preference of an expert you know, and become his apprentice. 
                —The apprentice must always wear the white belt, he must always be willing to learn.
                —The apprentice must be an enthusiast, especially when it comes to new technologies and willingness to learn them.
                —The apprentice must expose his ignorance. He must be willing to accept that he does not know it all.
                He finished his talk stating that we must not be afraid to do something different with our lives, and we must always be willing to share our knowledge.
                As the training continued through the week, something within myself started to awake.
                Communication class was one of the most interesting ones I have ever had, because the instructor brought up certain uncomfortable topics and explained them within a few words: for example, why are we not able to say the word “no” when we need to, or how many decisions we have taken are based on fear. I am really looking forward to assisting the next lecture.
                If I had to choose one single class/workshop that I consider the most useful in the past week, it would definitely be GTD Workshop. GTD stands for Getting Things Done, and, oh man, did the instructor get things done. She introduced us to this task management application called “Microsoft To Do”, and showed us how to properly use it. I can now confidently say that, from now on, I’ll be a better organized person.
                My last Workshop of the week was the Client intro Workshop. There, the instructor told us that the client is nothing else but another human being, and she highlighted the main obstacle that we, software engineers, really often face: silence; because, in a meeting, we are always participating, even if we are not saying anything.

                <b>About Nearsoft/Encora</b><hr/>
                We have reached the end of this essay: the best part. Everything I Learned about Nearsoft/Encora. The most interesting part.
                Where should I start?
                On monday —the very first day of this journey— I met Dayra and Luis, the Academy Staff. Luis has a cat!
                My very first class was Orientation 1: It was an introductory lecture on how Nearsoft operates and works. A little bit of history too.
                Then, it came Prep Viernes de Nuevos. Apparently we, as Nearsoft/Encora’s new acquisition, need to host an event called “Newbies’ Friday” in which we start getting along with some Nearsoftians outside of the Academy by doing some activities. I’m sure it’ll be really fun. The instructor of Do y no tan do taught us some details about security and what we should and shouldn’t do. In Welcome PD we met Mónica López, part of People and Culture. We also carry out the activity “two truths, one lie”, and it was really fun! I got to know a little more about my peers, and I loved it.
                And last, but definitely not least, Opportunities Pool. The instructor told us about it: he highlighted that being part of the Opportunities Pool is not a step before being fired, but a supportive team and a safe place to prepare ourselves for a new position.
                I’m sure there exists a lot of Nearsoft I don’t know about yet, and I’m here to learn it!
