            <h3>Encora Inc — Week 4</h3>
            <i>2020/10/26, 9:30 PM</i>
            <h3><b>Introduction</b></h3><hr/>
            <p align="justify">Oh, so fast we arrived at the end of the Reset Phase here at Encora. Time passes fast. Here I express everything I learned in the fourth week of the Reset Phase at Encora, which covers testing in a Software Development environment, the importance of making sure that we are building the right “it” before we build “it” right and a little bit of quantum mechanics.</p>
            <p align="justify">I hope you enjoy it.</p>
            <h3><b>About testing and pretotyping</b></h3><hr/>
            <p align="justify">Test engineering is a burgeoning field in Computer Science. Product quality & testability is a collective effort, but what does it really mean? In an environment where thousands of code changes per day, it’s  impossible to do exhaustive testing.</p>
            <p align="justify">Let’s take Netflix as an example: in November 2014, they had 2B requests per day. That’s… A lot. So, how do they test things, with such outstanding requests per day?</p>
            <p align="justify">It’s kinda… Interesting. One developer said “our system is so complex no (single) body knows how it works”. So, this is how another way was born: cause failure deliberately to validate resiliency, and test. Interestingly, they named this “chaos monkey”. In fact, there are a lot of monkeys out there, so here are some examples:</p>
            <p align="justify">
            <ul>
                <li>Chaos monkey:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Randomly terminates instances in a cluster</li>
                    <li>Simulates failures inherent to running in the cloud</li>
                    <li>During business hours</li>
                    <li>Default for production services</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Chaos Gorilla:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simulate an availability zone becoming unavailable</li>
                    <li>Validate multi-AZ redundancy</li>
                    <li>Deploy to multiple AZs by default</li>
                    <li>Run regularly</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Chaos Kong:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>One louder than chaos gorilla</li>
                    <li>Simulate an entire region outage</li>
                    <li>Used to validate our "active-active" region strategy</li>
                    <li>Traffic has to be switched</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Latency monkey:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simulate instances</li>
                    <li>Ensure degradation does not affect other services</li>
                    <li>Multiple scenarios: network</li>
                    <li>Validate that your service can handle degradation</li>
                    <li>Find effects on other services.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p align="justify">But, even with the correct testing and all the latter executed in a harmonious way, most new ideas fail even if they are very well executed. So, we must make sure that we are building the right “it” before we build “it” right. How can we achieve this?</p>
            <p align="justify">Well, there is this thing called Pretotype. Apparently, developing a pretotype is validating the markel appeal and actual usage of a potential new product by simulating its core experience with the smallest possible investment of time and money.</p>
            <p align="justify">Because, making sure we are building the right thing before we invest a lot in building it right it’s actually a pretty good idea. In the past week we were asked to develop three pretotypes and get results from it. I worked in one of those pretotypes, and I can confidently say that using this way of thinking is actually very important and valuable, because even before developing the actual project, we got lots and lots of users’ experiences and we could come to a conclusion of whether the project was viable or not..</p>

            <h3><b>About quantum mechanics and philosophy</b></h3><hr/>
            <p align="justify">“Roger. I’m on it. Here we go again” — If you get that reference I love you.</p>
            <p align="justify">All things are made of atoms, little particles that move around in perpetual motion.</p>
            <p align="justify">Attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.</p>
            <p align="justify">The latter is what we would absolutely need to know if all knowledge was removed from planet Earth, except for a couple of words.</p>
            <p align="justify">I would absolutely love to explain to you the foundations of quantum mechanics, but, the truth is, I can’t really understand it. And, as Seth Lloyd said, and I quote: “It's ok to not understand quantum mechanics. Because nobody does”.</p>
            <p align="justify">On the other hand, Wolfram’s theory of everything is really interesting, even though it's complex. He proposed a theory which states that the universe is formed by mathematical models similar to cellular automatons rules. And… That’s all I can say about it.</p>
            
            <h3><b>The takeaway</b></h3><hr/>
            <p align="justify">What's the value of ideas? Worthless, because, unless executed, ideas are just that… Ideas. It is precise for us to execute them, but more precise it’s to make sure that we are developing the right thing. </p>
            <p align="justify">Also, it's ok to not understand quantum mechanics. Because nobody does.</p>
