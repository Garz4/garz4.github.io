            <div style="max-width:600px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                    <h3><b>Introduction</b></h3><hr/>
                    <p align="justify">Hi again! Here I express a brief summary of everything I learned throughout the third week of the Reset Phase here at Nearsoft/Encora, from readings to videos. I hope you enjoy it.</p>

                    <h3><b>About ways of thinking and expressing them</b></h3><hr/>
                    <p align="justify">I can’t relate to Moonshot Thinking and everything it carries. Apparently, there’s something called Moonshot Thinking, and, briefly speaking, it means “aiming for the Moon”; it’s about setting an “impossible” (or ultra super hard) goal and pursuing it. I mean, the idea is kinda attractive, but when you think about it you take a lot of risks. I prefer setting small goals, achieving them and see if, at some point, I am going to be able to “reach the Moon”. When I recall that talk from Astro Teller covering the latter, I can help but feeling that maybe he didn’t express it the way he should have. Because one thing is believing with your whole heart a certain way of thinking —maybe a pretty good one—, and another completely different is expressing it to others. Thankfully, Enric Lladó and Marshall Goldsmith gave two really interesting talks about it: “La mejor presentación de tu vida” and “What Got You Here Won't Get You There: How Successful People Become Even More Successful”, which I will apply to my next Lightning Talks. Llandó explained that, when giving a talk (i.e. presenting your work to your boss), we must focus on two things: make them think and make them feel. He also gave really good tips on it. On the other hand, Goldsmith talked about becoming a leader and a partner, and all the steps it carries: asking, listening, thinking, thanking, responding, involving, changing and following up. He also corroborated what Llandó stated in his talk, and I translate: “the spark that makes people feel is making them take part”. I tried it in my first Lightning Talk, but I don’t know if I did it well, so I’m going to try it again.</p>

                    <h3><b>About programming and inventions</b></h3><hr/>
                    <p align="justify">I’ll start with programming and inventions:</p>
                    <p align="justify">“In 40 years we’ll not be writing code in text files”. The latter is a really interesting thought. Will it be? Bret Victor gave a talk about it, and he showed some examples: when the Assembly guys invented their programming language and told the Binary guys, the Binary guys said “I’m not interested”. Later, when the Fortran guys invented their programming language and told the Assembly guys, the Assembly guys said “I'm not interested, mine is programming, yours not”. Thinking about the future of programming and trying to picture it is kinda hard, but when you see what Victor showed in another talk, “Inventing on principle”, you start to realize that there are a lot of ways in which programming will evolve. It’s hard to explain what Victor showed, because when you write it it seems meaningless, so I highly recommend you watching it, at least a couple of minutes. Link: https://vimeo.com/36579366. (at 10:42 it gets really interesting).</p>
                    <p align="justify">The process of innovation is messy, because getting to a “no” quickly in an idea is almost as good as getting a “yes” quickly.</p>
                    <p align="justify">I just couldn’t find a way to link the latter with Machine learning, but since Machine learning is programming, here it is:</p>
                    <p align="justify">Machine learning. When I watched all the videos (that Encora required me to watch) from this topic I immediately recalled the two courses I took at the Computer Research Center, called “Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks” and “Foundations of Artificial Intelligence”. Machine learning is about programs that, given a set of data, learn how to predict. But of course, saying this does not make justice to all the details from Machine learning; nevertheless, you can’t say I’m wrong. :)</p>

                    <h3><b>About quantum physics</b></h3><hr/>
                    <p align="justify">I know, right? Quantum physics in a software development environment?</p>
                    <p align="justify">Since the topics I watched and read about are complex and require a lot of mathematical proofs, I am going to be brief and explain the general ideas:</p>
                    <p align="justify">Quantum physics is weird. It states that we are not able to determine the position in space and time of a single particle. Why, you ask? Because particles are weird. Apparently, they can be in two (or maybe more, I don’t know) places at the same time —a phenomenon called superposition—; but, when we try to measure where they are, this superposition thing breaks and they just stay in one place. Because, apparently, that’s how the universe works. It’s super super weird, and this is why I’m glad I didn’t choose physics as my career.</p>
                   
                    <h3><b>About professional training</b></h3><hr/>
                    <p align="justify">Creating a User-Based Recommender was interesting: when I first saw the big data problem I thought that I was supposed to code that recommender algorithm. But no. Mahout just does it for me.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Test, then code.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Then test, then integrate.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Then test, then deploy.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Then test, then release.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Then test, then steer.</p>
                    <p align="justify">And test again.</p>
                    <p align="justify">The latter is called “test-driven development” and, as you can already tell, it involves a lot of testing, because, and I quote: “tests help us keep promises regarding the quality, cost, and existence of previously installed features”. Interestingly enough, I gave a talk covering this topic, and highlighting that we must not want, at all costs, to implement the latter in our projects, because not every single project is capable of successfully achieving everything that test-driven development carries.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Similarly, there exists this thing called UnitTest which, if I understood it properly, it’s like test-driven development but with steroids (Solitary and Sociable tests, and speed). And, apparently, both came from something called Xunit.</p>
                    <p align="justify">On the other hand, when programming the latter we often use an IDE… But what if we didn’t? What if we coded directly on the terminal, like the good old days of programming? Well, we actually can: there are a lot of good editors that can be opened in the terminal, such as Nano and Vim. Learning Nano is like entering a house by its front door. Learning Vim is like trying to drill down an entire wall of that house. Or, at least, the latter is how I see it; nevertheless, Anish Athalye et al. gave a really cool lecture about it. Now I can at least say that I know how to switch to INSERT mode, and how to save and quit from Vim. :)</p>
                    <p align="justify">On the other hand, Git is really easy to use. And, interestingly enough, Anish Athalye et al. gave a really cool lecture about it too. </p>

                    <h3><b>The takeaway</b></h3><hr/>
                    <p align="justify">We are insignificant.</p>
                    <p align="justify">It’s better if we know how to express our ways of thinking.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Quantum physics is weird.</p>
                    <p align="justify">Machine learning is hella interesting.</p>
